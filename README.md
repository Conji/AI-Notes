# AI-Notes
>A personal collection of notes regarding AI development.

I am not a professional in machine learning or neural networking. Please take these notes with a pinch of salt. That being said, half of 
coding is devising a realistic and explainable solution, so this repository will be dedicated to my notes on each aspect of an AI I'm 
currently working on. This AI will have a different purpose than what most have, which is usually learning to solve problems we humans 
can't or can't be bothered to. This AI will be the target of replicating human speech patterns so it can also speak for itself. To fully 
implement that, it'll also need to be able to feel for itself. So it's quite the tall order, but it's also something I'm curious about.
